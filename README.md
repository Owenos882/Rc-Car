📄 README — ESP32 RC Car (WiFi Hotspot + Joystick Control)
🚗 Overview

This project transforms an ESP32 and L298N motor driver into a fully WiFi-controlled RC car using a mobile hotspot and a touch joystick interface.

The control interface is a webpage hosted by the ESP32, accessible from any smartphone.
The car supports full 360° analog steering, headlights, and a horn.

This version uses software-PWM to ensure compatibility with all ESP32 boards, even if hardware PWM is unavailable.
